% The original template (from Trevor) had a custom \appendix command,
% but I found it to break figure/table counters. I'm not sure how
% reliable my fix is, so I ended up reverting back to the standard
% latex version, and renaming the custom command to \myappendix.  You
% can try both and see how things work out:
% 1) Call \appendix once, and then make each appendix a \chapter
% 2) Call \myappendix once, and then make each appendix a \section.

%\appendix
\chapter{Example Figures}

% Appendix sections, subsections etc should not appear in the table of 
% contents. So set tocdepth to 0 and set it back to 2 at the end. Do 
% this for each appendix.
