% This is a sample appendix file to refer to after you replace the information in Appendix A with your own text
% Previous versions of this template note the options to use the custom command \myappendix or the built-in latex command \appendix. You can try both and see how things work out:
% 1) Call \appendix once, and then make each appendix a \chapter
% 2) Call \myappendix once, and then make each appendix a \section.
% However, I have found it to work better to just leave both commented out

%\appendix
\chapter{Example Appendix}

% Appendix sections, subsections etc should not appear in the table of 
% contents. So set tocdepth to 0 and set it back to 2 at the end. Do 
% this for each appendix.
