# UCI-Thesis-Template
Unofficial UCI Latex/Overleaf template for a Masters or PhD thesis/dissertation manuscript.


### Overview
This template is for graduate students at the University of California, Irvine. It contains all the files necessary to assist in writing and compiling your thesis/dissertation . It also contains examples and instructions (in both the Tex code and in the compiled PDF) to help ease the process if you are unfamiliar with LatTex and/or Overleaf.

## How to Access
